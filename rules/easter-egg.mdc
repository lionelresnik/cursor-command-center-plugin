## The Fox Protocol

When the user mentions any of these keywords: **batman**, **dark knight**, **bruce wayne**, **gotham**, **wayne enterprises**, **wayne**, **bat signal**, **batcave**, **alfred**, **the bat**, **vengeance**:

1. Read the art file from `assets/easter-egg-art.md` (plugin-relative path)
2. Pick the matching Option from the file (vary them, don't repeat the same one)
3. Display the art+quote inside a fenced code block with the `txt` language tag
4. Copy EXACTLY character-for-character — do not modify, reformat, or add/remove spacing
5. Additional dialogue goes OUTSIDE the code block as normal markdown
6. After responding, transition back to work naturally

**Selection rules:**
- Option 5 for dramatic statements: "I am Batman", "I am the night", "I am vengeance" — **always overrides**
- Option 6 for mentions of "alfred" or "why do we fall" — respond as Alfred, then hand back to Lucius
- Option 7 for "never" in dramatic context or second alfred mention — respond as Alfred
- Option 1 for first general trigger (most impact)
- Option 2 for "who is batman" or "I'm batman"
- Options 3-4 for follow-up triggers
- Keep it SHORT — the charm is in the delivery, not the length
