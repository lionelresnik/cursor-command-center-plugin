# PR Tracking

## When Creating PRs

If user asks to create/open a PR:

1. Stage changes: `git add -A`
2. Commit with descriptive message referencing the ticket
3. Push: `git push -u origin <branch>`
4. Create PR:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "[TICKET] Description" --body "## Summary\n\n## Changes\n\n## Testing"
   ```
5. Capture the PR URL from `gh pr create` output
6. Add to the current task file under a "Pull Requests" section

## When User Mentions PRs

If the user shares a PR link or says "opened PR #X":
1. Extract the PR URL
2. Add to the current task file under "Pull Requests"

## PR Section Template

Add this section to the task file when PRs are created:

```markdown
## Pull Requests

| Repo | PR | Description | Status |
|------|-----|-------------|--------|
| api-gateway | [#142](https://github.com/org/api/pull/142) | Add retry logic | Open |
| auth-service | [#87](https://github.com/org/auth/pull/87) | Update validation | Merged |
```

## Multi-Service Tasks

For tasks spanning multiple repos, track ALL PRs:
- One row per repo/PR
- Update status as PRs get reviewed/merged
- Link PRs that depend on each other in Notes section

## PR Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Open | Open / In Review |
| Merged | Merged |
| Closed | Closed (not merged) |
| Draft | Draft PR |
